## Understanding AI Systems

### AI Models vs AI Agents

| Feature | AI Models | AI Agents |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Nature | Passive word calculators | Active autonomous systems |
| Operation | Waits for input to respond | Operates independently |
| Context | Processes each input separately | Maintains conversation history |
| Decision Making | Generates predictions based on input | Makes autonomous decisions |
| Examples | GPT, Gemini | Eliza, Trading bots |
